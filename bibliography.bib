	abstract     = {In this paper, we show that an account centred around modal subordination and contrastive topic may account for most if not all of the known data on reverse Sobel sequence felicity. We show that contrastive stress in rSSs often targets the auxiliary verb and that, in doing so, we actually target the tense-aspect-mood information that is encoded by it. By treating tense-aspect-mood as a type of bound pro-form, adopting the pro-form semantics of Jacobson (2000; 2004), we show that, in doing so, we are actually trying to contrast the two conditionals’ domains of quantification. As such, the contrastive topic is successful iff the two domains are disjoint, preventing a modally subordinate reading, allowing for the possibility of reverse Sobel sequence felicity.},
